# WINDOWS SERVER 2012 & WINDOWS 8 COMPILER INSTALLATION

DescriptionÂ  The jBASE compiler installer checks for a working C compiler if a version of Visual Studio is already installed. If a working C compiler is not found, the jBASE compiler installer directs the user to the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017" web page to install Visual Studio. However Visual Studio 2017 is not supported on Windows Server
