# SEL-RESTORE

The jBASE sel-restore command enables users to restore all or specific records into a jBASE file from an ACCOUNT-SAVE or FILE-SAVE. The command prompts for the name of source account and file held on the media, unless the restore by file number option has been used, in which case the user is prompted for the number of the source file on the media.
