# List Storage

DescriptionÂ  The jBASEWORK file is a temporary file which contains information specific to jBASE processes and ports while executing applications. This file should not be accessed while any jBASE processes are active. The jBASEWORK file also contains default or numbered select lists. These select lists are temporary and so do not need to be deleted.
