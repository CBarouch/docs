Description jQL: MCC conversion code issues  Previous Release Behavior Two issues:  The MCC code would consume all memory when there were @SVMs in the data.  The Umlaute character would cause unpredictible behavior, e.g.  001 A 002 0 003 004 005 006 007 008 A;(N(attn)(MCC;û;u)) 009 L 010 14 Because "Umlaute" can have the same ASCII values as jBASE d
