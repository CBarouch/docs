# PN5_60566

Description Updates to XML library.  Fix issue with corruption in resulting XML, previously tag names would be corrupted with whatever is hanging around in memory.  Merge windows and UNIX code, seemed silly to have two separate functions that are almost identical.  Add new function to jBC, [XML.REMOVE.TAG.VALUE]  New function: [XML.REMOVE.TAG.VALUE]
