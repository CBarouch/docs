# DISTRIBUTED FILES EXAMPLES

In this comprehensive example, we create a distributed file called DISTCUST using a user defined partition algorithm and attaching five part files. Create the distributed file stub. This is the file to which all part files will be attached: jsh --&gt;CREATE-FILE DISTCUST TYPE=DISTRIB [ 417 ] File DISTCUST]D created , type = J4 [ 417 ] File DISTCUST
