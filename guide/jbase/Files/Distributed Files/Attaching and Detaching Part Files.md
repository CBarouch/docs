# Attaching and Detaching Part Files

DescriptionÂ  Files are attached to a distributed file using the CREATE-DISTRIB command with the -a option. A file must already exist before it can be attached to a distributed file. In the following example an existing file, DISTCUST.SOUTH, is attached to the distributed file DISTCUST as part number 4: jsh DEMO ~ --&gt; create-distrib -a DISTCUST 4
