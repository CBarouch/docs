The **HEADINGE**statement is the same as the [HEADING](276079-heading) statement, which causes a page eject with the [HEADING](276079-heading) statement.

The **HEADINGN**statement is the same as the [HEADING](276079-heading) statement, and suppresses the page eject.

Go back to [jBASE BASIC](263498-jbase-basic).
