# DescriptionÂ 

The **DATE** function returns the date in internal system form. This date is expressed as the number of days since December 31, 1967. It takes the general form:

```
DATE()
```

## Note:


> The system and jBASE programs should manipulate date fields in internal form. They can then be converted to a preferred readable format using the [OCONV](277483-oconv) function and the date conversion codes.


An example of use can be as:

```
CRT OCONV(DATE(), "D2")
```

To display today's date in the form: dd MMM yy.
