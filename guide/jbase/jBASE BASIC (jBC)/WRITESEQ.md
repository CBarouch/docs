## Note:Â 


> Each **WRITESEQ**writes the data on a line of the sequentially opened file. Each data is suffixed with a new line character. After each **WRITESEQ**, the file pointer moves forward to the end of line. The WRITESEQF statement forces each data line to be flushed to the file when it is written. The APPEND option forces each **WRITESEQ** to advance to the end of the file before writing the next data line.
