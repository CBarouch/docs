# JBASEUNIQUE

Description When this environment variable is set to a directory, jBASE dynamically creates the workfiles based on port number and clears the contents of them when a new user connects to that port. The 'workfiles' are created as '$JBASEUNIQUE/jBASEWORK_portno'. No dictionary is created (or needed). This environment variable superceeds JBCBASETMP.Â  V
