# Dynamic Objects: Static Methods

A Static Method is one that can be used without creating an object. This means the calling object (identified as this-&gt;) is either illegal or inconsequential.Â  In other object oriented languages a static method would be identified with the keyword static and the compiler would give an error if it was referenced with this-&gt; or self or whatever
