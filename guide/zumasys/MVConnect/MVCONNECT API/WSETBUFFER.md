# WSETBUFFER

The WSETBUFFER subroutine enables or disables buffering of content passed to the WSEND subroutine. It accepts a single argument, specifying the buffer size in characters, or zero to disable buffering. Buffering may improve performance, and also may aid in producing cleaner output, especially if your handler displays spurious error or warning message
