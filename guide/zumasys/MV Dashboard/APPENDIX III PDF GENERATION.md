# APPENDIX III: PDF GENERATION

MV Dashboard can be configured to generate PDF versions of most widgets. An external PDF conversion utility is used to transform widget HTML into a PDF file, which is then sent to the user's browser for display or saving.Â  In order to use the PDF feature, an appropriate HTML to PDF conversion utility must be installed on the same server as MV Dashbo
