How to utilize the Skype for Business conference phone.



You can book meetings on it like a regular resource room and it should auto-accept your invite (same way the upstairsconf or downstairsconf worked for Irvine). Here are the easy steps.

When setting up a new meeting click on the "Rooms..." button in Outlook meeting invite

You should get a list of rooms available - one of which will be "San Clemente Conference Room" - double-click on that and hit OK

Enable the meeting as a Skype meeting and you should be good to go.

You'll receive a response from the "room" noting the status of your meeting acceptance. Please note that it will auto-decline if there is any conflict and the phone will not be able to join a meeting if this happens.
