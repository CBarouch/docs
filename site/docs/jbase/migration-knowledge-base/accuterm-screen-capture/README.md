Click on "End Capture" to stop.  It will now write out the results of the screen capture to the "Capture to File" specified in step 2.  This is just a text file with everything that was typed in and what the screen displayed.

Clicking on "Continue" will minimize the widget and return focus back to the main window so you can continue working.
