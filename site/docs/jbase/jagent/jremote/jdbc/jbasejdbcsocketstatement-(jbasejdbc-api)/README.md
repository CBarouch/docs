**Specified by:**`cancel` in interface `Statement`
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs




#### **clearBatch**

```
public void clearBatch()
                throws SQLException
```

Empties this Statement object's current list of SQL commands. NOTE: This method is optional.
**Specified by:**`clearBatch` in interface `Statement`

#### **clearWarnings**

```
public void clearWarnings()
                   throws SQLException

**Specified by:**`clearWarnings` in interface `Statement`
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs




#### **close**

```
public void close()
           throws SQLException
```

Releases this Statement object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. It is generally good practice to release resources as soon as you are finished with them to avoid tying up database resources. Calling the method close on a Statement object that is already closed has no effect. Note: A Statement object is automatically closed when it is garbage collected [TODO: not yet implemented]. [TODO:] When a Statement object is closed, its current ResultSet object, if one exists, is also closed.

**Specified by:**`close` in interface `AutoCloseable`
**Specified by:**`close` in interface `Statement`
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs





#### **getMoreResults**

```
public boolean getMoreResults()
                       throws SQLException
```

Moves to this Statement object's next result, returns true if it is a ResultSet object, and implicitly closes any current ResultSet object(s) obtained with the method getResultSet. There are no more results when the following is true: // stmt is a Statement object ((stmt.getMoreResults() == false) && (stmt.getUpdateCount() == -1))
**Specified by:**`getMoreResults` in interface `Statement`
**Returns:**true if the next result is a ResultSet object; false if it is an update count or there are no more results
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs




#### **executeBatch**

```
public int[] executeBatch()
                   throws SQLException
```

Submits a batch of commands to the database for execution and if all commands execute successfully, returns an array of update counts. The int elements of the array that is returned are ordered to correspond to the commands in the batch, which are ordered according to the order in which they were added to the batch. The elements in the array returned by the method executeBatch may be one of the following:A number greater than or equal to zero -- indicates that the command was processed successfully and is an update count giving the number of rows in the database that were affected by the command's execution
A value of SUCCESS\_NO\_INFO -- indicates that the command was processed successfully but that the number of rows affected is unknown. If one of the commands in a batch update fails to execute properly, this method throws a BatchUpdateException, and a JDBC driver may or may not continue to process the remaining commands in the batch. However, the driver's behavior must be consistent with a particular DBMS, either always continuing to process commands or never continuing to process commands. If the driver continues processing after a failure, the array returned by the method BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts will contain as many elements as there are commands in the batch, and at least one of the elements will be the following:
A value of EXECUTE\_FAILED -- indicates that the command failed to execute successfully and occurs only if a driver continues to process commands after a command fails
A driver is not required to implement this method. The possible implementations and return values have been modified in the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3 to accommodate the option of continuing to proccess commands in a batch update after a BatchUpdateException obejct has been thrown.

**Specified by:**`executeBatch` in interface `Statement`
**Returns:**an array of update counts containing one element for each command in the batch. The elements of the array are ordered according to the order in which commands were added to the batch.
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the driver does not support batch statements.`BatchUpdateException` - (a subclass of SQLException) if one of the commands sent to the database fails to execute properly or attempts to return a result set.





#### **setFetchDirection**

```
public void setFetchDirection(int direction)
                       throws SQLException
```

Gives the driver a hint as to the direction in which rows will be processed in ResultSet objects created using this Statement object. The default value is ResultSet.FETCH\_FORWARD. Note that this method sets the default fetch direction for result sets generated by this Statement object. Each result set has its own methods for getting and setting its own fetch direction.
**Specified by:**`setFetchDirection` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`direction` - the initial direction for processing rows
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the given direction is not one of ResultSet.FETCH\_FORWARD, ResultSet.FETCH\_REVERSE, or ResultSet.FETCH\_UNKNOWN




#### **setFetchSize**

```
public void setFetchSize(int rows)
                  throws SQLException
```

Gives the JDBC driver a hint as to the number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows are needed. The number of rows specified affects only result sets created using this statement. If the value specified is zero, then the hint is ignored. The default value is zero.
**Specified by:**`setFetchSize` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`rows` - the number of rows to fetch
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs, or the condition 0 &lt;= rows &lt;= this.getMaxRows() is not satisfied.
**See Also:**[`Statement.getFetchSize()`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html?is-external=true#getFetchSize-- "class or interface in java.sql")




#### **setMaxFieldSize**

```
public void setMaxFieldSize(int max)
                     throws SQLException
```

Sets the limit for the maximum number of bytes in a ResultSet column storing character or binary values to the given number of bytes. This limit applies only to BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and LONGVARCHAR fields. If the limit is exceeded, the excess data is silently discarded. For maximum portability, use values greater than 256.
**Specified by:**`setMaxFieldSize` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`max` - the new column size limit in bytes; zero means there is no limit
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the condition max &gt;= 0 is not satisfied
**See Also:**[`Statement.getMaxFieldSize()`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html?is-external=true#getMaxFieldSize-- "class or interface in java.sql")




#### **setMaxRows**

```
public void setMaxRows(int max)
                throws SQLException
```

**Specified by:**`setMaxRows` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`max` - the new max rows limit; zero means there is no limit
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the condition max &gt;= 0 is not satisfied
**See Also:**[`Statement.getMaxRows()`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html?is-external=true#getMaxRows-- "class or interface in java.sql")




#### **setQueryTimeout**

```
public void setQueryTimeout(int seconds)
                     throws SQLException
```

Sets the number of seconds the driver will wait for a Statement object to execute to the given number of seconds. If the limit is exceeded, an SQLException is thrown.
**Specified by:**`setQueryTimeout` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`seconds` - - the new query timeout limit in seconds; zero means there is no limit
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the condition seconds &gt;= 0 is not satisfied
**See Also:**[`Statement.getQueryTimeout()`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html?is-external=true#getQueryTimeout-- "class or interface in java.sql")




#### **getMoreResults**

```
public boolean getMoreResults(int current)
                       throws SQLException
```

Moves to this Statement object's next result, deals with any current ResultSet object(s) according to the instructions specified by the given flag, and returns true if the next result is a ResultSet object. There are no more results when the following is true: // stmt is a Statement object ((stmt.getMoreResults() == false) && (stmt.getUpdateCount() == -1))
**Specified by:**`getMoreResults` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`current` - one of the following Statement constants indicating what should happen to current ResultSet objects obtained using the method getResultSet: Statement.CLOSE\_CURRENT\_RESULT, Statement.KEEP\_CURRENT\_RESULT, or Statement.CLOSE\_ALL\_RESULTS
**Returns:**true if the next result is a ResultSet object; false if it is an update count or there are no more results
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the argument supplied is not one of the following: Statement.CLOSE\_CURRENT\_RESULT, Statement.KEEP\_CURRENT\_RESULT, or Statement.CLOSE\_ALL\_RESULTS




#### **setEscapeProcessing**

```
public void setEscapeProcessing(boolean enable)
                         throws SQLException
```

Sets escape processing on or off. If escape scanning is on (the default), the driver will do escape substitution before sending the SQL statement to the database. Note: Since prepared statements have usually been parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for PreparedStatements objects will have no effect.

**Specified by:**`setEscapeProcessing` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`enable` - - true to enable escape processing; false to disable it
**Throws:**`SQLException` - - if a database access error occurs





#### **executeUpdate**

```
public int executeUpdate(String sql)
                  throws SQLException
```

Executes the given SQL statement, which may be an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or an SQL statement that returns nothing, such as an SQL DDL statement.

**Specified by:**`executeUpdate` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`sql` - an SQL INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement or an SQL statement that returns nothing
**Returns:**either the row count for INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements, or 0 for SQL statements that return nothing
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the given SQL statement produces a ResultSet object





#### **addBatch**

```
public void addBatch(String sql)
              throws SQLException
```

Adds the given SQL command to the current list of commmands for this Statement object. The commands in this list can be executed as a batch by calling the method executeBatch. NOTE: This method is optional.

**Specified by:**`addBatch` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`sql` - - typically this is a static SQL INSERT or UPDATE statement
**Throws:**`SQLException` - - if a database access error occurs, or the driver does not support batch updates
**See Also:**[`Statement.executeBatch()`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html?is-external=true#executeBatch-- "class or interface in java.sql")





#### **setCursorName**

```
public void setCursorName(String name)
                   throws SQLException
```

Sets the SQL cursor name to the given String, which will be used by subsequent Statement object execute methods. This name can then be used in SQL positioned update or delete statements to identify the current row in the ResultSet object generated by this statement. If the database does not support positioned update/delete, this method is a noop. To insure that a cursor has the proper isolation level to support updates, the cursor's SELECT statement should have the form SELECT FOR UPDATE. If FOR UPDATE is not present, positioned updates may fail. Note: By definition, the execution of positioned updates and deletes must be done by a different Statement object than the one that generated the ResultSet object being used for positioning. Also, cursor names must be unique within a connection.

**Specified by:**`setCursorName` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`name` - the new cursor name, which must be unique within a connection
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs





#### **getId**

```
public StatementID getId()
```

This is a jBASE JDBC driver's private method, not part of the JDBC API.
**Returns:**a string uniquely identifying this statement object.





#### **setId**

```
public void setId(StatementID _statementId)
           throws SQLException
```

**Throws:**`SQLException`




#### **freeId**

```
public void freeId()
            throws SQLException
```

**Throws:**`SQLException`




#### **execute**

```
public boolean execute(String sql)
                throws SQLException
```

Executes the given SQL statement, which may return multiple results. In some (uncommon) situations, a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are: (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result, and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s).

**Specified by:**`execute` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`sql` - any SQL statement
**Returns:**true if the first result is a ResultSet object; false if it is an update count or there are no results.
**Throws:**`SQLException` - - if a database access error occurs





#### **executeUpdate**

```
public int executeUpdate(String sql, int autoGeneratedKeys)
                  throws SQLException
```

Executes the given SQL statement and signals the driver with the given flag about whether the auto-generated keys produced by this Statement object should be made available for retrieval.

**Specified by:**`executeUpdate` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`sql` - must be an SQL INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement or an SQL statement that returns nothing`autoGeneratedKeys` - a flag indicating whether auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval; one of the following constants: Statement.RETURN\_GENERATED\_KEYS Statement.NO\_GENERATED\_KEYS
**Returns:**either the row count for INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements, or 0 for SQL statements that return nothing
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs, the given SQL statement returns a ResultSet object, or the given constant is not one of those allowed





#### **execute**

```
public boolean execute(String sql, int autoGeneratedKeys)
                throws SQLException
```

Executes the given SQL statement, which may return multiple results, and signals the driver that any auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval. The driver will ignore this signal if the SQL statement is not an INSERT statement. In some (uncommon) situations, a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result, and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s).

**Specified by:**`execute` in interface `Statement`
**Parameters:**`sql` - any SQL statement`autoGeneratedKeys` - a constant indicating whether auto-generated keys should be made available for retrieval using the method getGeneratedKeys; one of the following constants: Statement.RETURN\_GENERATED\_KEYS or Statement.NO\_GENERATED\_KEYS
**Returns:**true if the first result is a ResultSet object; false if it is an update count or there are no results
**Throws:**`SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the second parameter supplied to this method is not Statement.RETURN\_GENERATED\_KEYS or Statement.NO\_GENERATED\_KEYS.

#### **execute**

```
public boolean execute(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)
                throws SQLException
```

Executes the given SQL statement, which may return multiple results, and signals the driver that the auto-generated keys indicated in the given array should be made available for retrieval. This array contains the indexes of the columns in the target table that contain the auto-generated keys that should be made available. The driver will ignore the array if the given SQL statement is not an INSERT statement. Under some (uncommon) situations, a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result, and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s).
