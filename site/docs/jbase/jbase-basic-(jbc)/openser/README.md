# Description

The **OPENSER** statement is used to handle Serial IO. Serial IO to the COM ports on NT and to device files, achieves this on UNIX by Â using the sequential file statements. In addition, certain control operations can be performed using the [IOCTL function](./../ioctl). The **OPENSER** function takes the general form:

```
OPENSER Path,DevInfo| PIPE TO FileVar THEN | ELSE Statements
```

Where :

Path is the pathname of the required device.

DevInfo consists of the following:


| Baud<br> | <br> | Baud rate required<br> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow<br> | y<br> | X-ON X-OFF flow control (default)<br> |
| <br> | n<br> | no flow control<br> |
| <br> | i<br> | input flow contro<br> |
| <br> | o<br> | output flow control<br> |
| Parity<br> | e<br> | 7 bit even parity<br> |
| <br> | o<br> | 7 bit odd parity<br> |
| <br> | n<br> | 8 bit no parity (default)<br> |
| <br> | s<br> | 8 bit no parity, strip top bit<br> |
| PIPE<br> | <br> | specifies the file is to be opened to a PIPE for reading.<br> |


# 


## Note:


> The PIPE functionality allows a process to open a PIPE, once opened then the process can execute a command via the [WRITESEQ](./../writeseq)/[SEND](./../send) statement and then received the result back via the [GET](./../get)/[READSEQ](./../readseq) statements.


An example of use is as:

```
FileName = "/dev/tty01s"
OPENSER FileName TO File ELSE STOP 201,FileName
WRITESEQ "ls -ail" ON File,"" ;* ONLY for PIPEs
LOOP
    Terminator = CHAR (10)
    WaitTime = 4
    GET Input
    WAITING WaitTime THEN
        CRT "Get Ok, Input ":Input:" Count ":Count:"TermChar":TermChar
    END ELSE
        CRT "Get Timed out Input ":Input:" Count ":Count:" TermChar":TermChar
    END
WHILE Input NE "" DO
REPEAT
```
